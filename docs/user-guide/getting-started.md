## Request a System API key and Secret key
Before you get started, you need to request an API key (and secret key) from the administrator of the CATCH-A API instance with which you want to connect.

## What's next?

### Using LTI
Once you have your API key and secret key, you can plug those values into your LTI tool (see LTI documentation for more information). The LTI tool will generate a token and make requests against the CATCH API. 

### Using command line 
See [API Docs](api.md) for more information.

### Using annotatorjs client 
See [AnnotatorJs Docs](annotatorjs.md) for more information.
